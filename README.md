# Deep Learning Assignments and Projects

This repository contains all the assignments and projects completed as part of the **Deep Learning** course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The course covers foundational deep learning concepts, including neural networks, backpropagation, and various architectures like CNNs and RNNs.

Each folder in this repository represents an individual assignment or project, with the following:

- **Assignment Files**: Includes Jupyter notebooks with code, explanations, and results.
- **Project Files**: Contains more comprehensive projects where I applied deep learning techniques to real-world problems.

## Topics Covered:
- Neural Networks
- Backpropagation
- Regularization
- Optimization Algorithms (e.g., Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Installation and Setup:
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
